# Salesforce Project â€“ Lead Management Automation

## Problem
Leads are captured manually, causing delays, duplication, and data errors.  
This impacts sales team productivity and revenue.

## Proposed Solution
A Salesforce-based Lead Management System to:
- Automate lead capture from all channels
- Use Flows and Apex to assign leads, trigger notifications
- Enforce validation and prevent duplicates
- Provide real-time dashboards and reports
- Train users for high adoption

## Key Features
- Automated lead capture (forms, emails, etc)
- Automatic assignment & reminders
- Duplicate & validation rules
- Dashboards/reports
- User guides

## Project Phases
1. Discovery: Document sales workflows
2. Data Modeling: Design Lead object & validation
3. Automation: Build Flows
4. Apex Development: Triggers for assignment
5. UI Customization: Lightning pages
6. Reporting: Dashboards
7. Adoption: Training docs
