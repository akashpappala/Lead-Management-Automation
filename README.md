# Salesforce Project â€“ Lead Management Automation

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
In the current sales process, leads are captured manually from different channels (emails, calls, forms).  
This causes:
- Delayed follow-ups
- Duplicate/incomplete records
- Lost revenue opportunities
- Reduced sales team productivity

**Impact:**
- Lost customers due to slow response  
- Wasted hours in manual entry and data cleanup  
- Inaccurate sales forecasts

## ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution
We will design and implement a **Salesforce-based Lead Management System** to automate lead capture, tracking, and follow-ups.  

### Key Features
- **Automated Lead Capture**: Integrate multiple sources (forms, emails) directly into Salesforce.  
- **Lead Assignment & Notifications**: Use Flows and Apex triggers to assign leads automatically and send follow-up reminders.  
- **Duplicate & Validation Rules**: Ensure data quality by preventing duplicate entries and enforcing required fields.  
- **Dashboards & Reports**: Real-time dashboards for managers to track pipeline and monitor lead conversion.  
- **User Training & Adoption**: Provide quick-start guides so sales reps adopt the system easily.  

### Expected Benefits
- 95% of leads followed up within 24 hours  
- 80% reduction in duplicate records  
- 50% less time spent on manual entry  
- 15% higher lead conversion rate
