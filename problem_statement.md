# Problem Statement: Inefficient Lead Management & Follow-Ups

## Background
In the current sales process, leads are collected through multiple channels such as emails, phone calls, and web forms. However, most of this information is entered manually into the system and there is no standardized process for tracking or following up. As a result, many leads are either delayed in response or completely lost in the process.

## The Problem
- Leads are not captured consistently across all channels.
- Manual entry causes errors and missing information.
- There are no automated reminders or workflows to ensure timely follow-ups.
- Duplicate or incomplete records reduce the efficiency of the sales team.

## Impact of the Problem
- Lost revenue opportunities due to missed or delayed lead follow-up.
- Reduced customer satisfaction and trust in the sales process.
- Sales team productivity decreases because of manual work and rework.
- Business leaders cannot rely on accurate forecasts due to incomplete lead data.

## Desired Outcomes
- Centralized, automated lead capture from all key channels into Salesforce.
- Automated workflows and reminders to ensure every lead is followed up within SLA (Service Level Agreement).
